## User Story
I am using a daily planner to create a schedule.
I then open the planner.
From there current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.
I scroll down and I'm presented with time blocks for standard business hours.
I view the time blocks for that day then each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.
I click into a time block then I enter an event.
I click the save button for that time block then the text for that event is saved in local storage.
When I refresh the page the saved events persist.
